## Description

This is a TypeScript command line application that uses postgresql to query data tables and to performance actions. This helps to manage a company's employee database. The user has the ability to choose to view the data in the Department, Role, and Employee table, view employees by manager or view employees by department. Users can add Employees, Roles, and Departments.

For the next updates, I would like to add the ability to adjust salaries more easily, and the ability to combines empoyees under a new manager.

## Usage

In the command line, navigate (cd 'folder name') to the db folder. 1. In the command line enter 'postgres -U [username]' 2. Enter \i schema.sql
This will create your databse, tables, and also connect to your newly created database.

    3. Enter \i seeds.sql
    This will populate the tables with data.

    4. Enter \i q to exit out of postgres.

Once the sql files have ran, navigate to the folder with index.ts and enter bun run index.ts in the command line.
